# Konnie

Konnie is a task runner geared towards the manipulation of XML application config files.

Some tasks that can be performed are: 

- applying XML transforms
- substitute variables into files
- stop and start services
- assert existence or non existence of XPaths


###Konnie likes to###

- be sloth where possible.
- fail fast and if in doubt.
- be really loud, whatever she is doing.
- transform before substituting values.
- be simple rather than fast.
- Not create files, only overwrite them


### Konnie responds to ###

gruntfile inspired json files which can be combined and built into POCOs which can be run.
